        <p><b>Consider the impact of the Internet on privacy</b></p>
        <p>With the advent of the internet, privacy has become a more complex issue than ever before. 
        It is now easier for individuals to have their personal data stolen and used for nefarious purposes such as fraud or identity theft.
        Social media has had an especially significant impact on people's privacy, as people often divulge too much about their lives online without considering potential consequences for their safety or security (Darell, 2020). 
        Additionally, companies may also need to carry out background checks in order to verify individual’s qualifications or work history (M., 2023). That said, it is essential that strong measures are taken to protect Internet users' data and ensure its safekeeping so that it will remain private between two parties (M., 2023).
        <p><b>Locate at least two current articles about monitoring user activity online by private companies or governments. 
            Why are users monitored, how can they prevent this, can privacy be accomplished online?</b></p>
        <p>Research from Auxier et al. (2020) shows that people are generally worried about the way companies collect, store, and use their personal data. Only 9% of the population is concerned about what family or friends may know, as well as 19% concerning what employers may know. Regarding this same trend, majority of users assume that companies and government continuously track and monitor both online and offline activities (Auxier et al., 2020). In fact, 60% of U.S. adults believe it's impossible to go through day-to-day life without being monitored by organizations or the state (Auxier et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Recent research by Levinson-Waldman et al. suggests that many governments seek to aggregate as much data on citizen activities and preferences as possible, such as online activity, search terms, communication via social media, and so forth (2022). Despite these frequent intrusions into their everyday lives, many citizens view these practices as necessary for protection purposes; they don't expect the government to be monitoring if they observe proper conduct. Thus, the population is generally willing to abide by laws set forth by their respective governments, even when those regulations may appear illogical in comparison with their daily habits.</p>
        <p>To ensure the safety of their nations, governments often use surveillance methods to monitor their citizens (Levinson-Waldman et al., 2022). Moreover, companies such as Google and Facebook collect data in order to develop targeted marketing campaigns, but they do so without resorting to overly intrusive techniques (Buchanan, 2014). Therefore, VPNs are now essential for users who desire a secure online experience. By encrypting all your internet traffic and hiding it from the government and ISPs (Internet Service Providers), VPNs can keep your activities private and safe from prying eyes (Levinson-Waldman et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>Finally, yes, one can attain online privacy by taking certain steps, such as committing to curbing the sharing of personal information, employing secure passwords and two-factor authentication, amplifying account security settings, removing extraneous mobile applications and browser add-ons, disallowing search engine tracking, browsing the internet through a safe VPN platform and updating software regularly. Additionally, disabling advertisement tracking and data collection is immensely beneficial (Masjedi, 2023).</p>
